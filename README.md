# Davide Di Criscito

**Architect of runes and code, diviner of machines, disciple of open-source.**

---

ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m **Davide (Dave) Di Criscito** â€” a full-stack developer and digital wanderer.  
I craft **websites** and **developer tools for Node.js** using **TypeScript** and **React**, building bridges between gothic ruins and neon skylines of the web.  

For me, programming is more than syntax: it is **divination**.  
Each line of code is a **rune**, a verse in my **codex** â€” my personal *Book of Shadows*.  
I spawn **daemons**, guided by AI familiars as oracles, and I believe in **open-source** as a gospel: code must be free and luminous, accessible to everyone.  

âš¡ Tech stack:  
- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Node.js, React  
- **Focus**: Web development, Dev Tools, Full-Stack Engineering  

ðŸŒ² Outside of code, I draw inspiration from gothic horror, poetry, forests, and the untouched silence of nature.
